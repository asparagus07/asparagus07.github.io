I am a PhD candidate at Scuola Normale Superiore. My research focuses on mobilization strategies of transnational climate movements and their economic impacts. Using a mixed-methods design, I combine process tracing, comparative analysis, and event study analysis to bridge quantitative and qualitative methodological approaches. In my PhD research, I am adopting a processual perspective, emphasizing the viewpoints and agency of movement actors.

I completed both my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Social Sciences at Humboldt University Berlin with a scholarship from the Heinrich Böll Foundation, graduating with distinction.  In 2023, I taught the course "Sociology of the Teenage Girl" at Humboldt University. 

In 2025, I was elected to the board the German institute for protest and movement research ipb.
